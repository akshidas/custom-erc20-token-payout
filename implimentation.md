## How to implement the TodoList contract with the Todo token

- When a user connects to the contract save the address of the user and send him some Token(so that he/she/they/them/* can add a task).
- When the user adds a task they need to stake some tokens from their wallets to the contract.
- There will be deadline for the task.
- The contract will calculate the rate of return based on the speed the task was completed.
- If the user failed to complete the task the amount will be taken back by the contract from the user.
- The user can use a portal to buy more tokens when they don't have enough token to add a task.
